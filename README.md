# Real Time Bus Tracker Project

The Real Time Bus Tracker visualizes live bus data for the MIT and Harvard area using animated markers on a map, leveraging the Mapbox API and asynchronous JavaScript.

## How to Run
- Clone the repo
- Replace `mapboxgl.accessToken` with your Mapbox token in `mapanimation.js`
- Load `index.html` in your browser to view the bus locations in real-time.

## Roadmap
- Expand to cover more routes
- Incorporate estimated arrival times.
